# Welcome to my Heroku ML Deployment Project!

In this project I:

1. Create Random Forest model to classify income based on various demographic/financial factors and save (pickle) it
2. Create Flask files for UI and python main file (app.py) that can unpickle the ML model from step 1 and make predictions
3. Create requirements.txt to setup Flask web app with all python dependencies
4. Create Procfile to initiate Flask app command
5. Commit files from Step 1, 2, 3 & 4 to this GitHub repo
6. Create account/Login on Heroku, create an app, connect with GitHub repo, and select branch
7. Manually deploy on Heroku
8. Enjoy the app [here](https://income-predictor-api.herokuapp.com)!
